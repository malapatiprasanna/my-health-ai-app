Project Overview: HealthAI
HealthAI is an AI-powered healthcare web application that provides intelligent, personalized medical guidance to users. 
It integrates IBM’s Granite-13B-Instruct-v2 language model to simulate the behavior of a virtual health assistant. 
The project is built using Streamlit for the frontend, Python for backend logic, and Plotly for dynamic health data visualizations.

Key Features:
🗣 Patient Chat
Users can ask any health-related questions, and the AI responds with empathetic, informative, and safe answers based on trusted medical patterns.

🔍 Disease Prediction
Based on the user’s input symptoms and profile (age, gender, medical history), HealthAI predicts possible conditions, their likelihood, and next recommended steps.

📋 Treatment Plan Generator
For known conditions, the AI creates evidence-based personalized treatment plans, including medication suggestions, lifestyle tips, and follow-up actions.

📊 Health Analytics Dashboard
Users can view trends in simulated health metrics (heart rate, blood pressure, glucose levels) via interactive charts, along with AI-generated health insights.

Technology Stack:
Frontend: Streamlit (with responsive UI and tabs)

Backend: Python (with session state and logic layers)

AI Model: IBM Granite-13B-Instruct-v2 via Hugging Face or WatsonX APIs

Data Visualization: Plotly for charts and health metrics

Environment Management: dotenv, virtualenv
